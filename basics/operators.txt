    || (logical OR) condition 1 || condition 2 || condition 3 just one condition true it will be execute next block code
    && (logical AND) condition 1 && condition 2 && condition 3 must be true to execute next block code

    & (bitwise AND)
    | (bitwise OR)
    ^ (bitwise XOR)
    &^ (bitwise AND NOT)
    << (left shift)
    >> (right shift)

Comparison Operators:
    == (equal)
    != (not equal)
    < (less than)
    <= (less than equal to)
